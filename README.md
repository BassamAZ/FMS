# **Fleet Management System**

**An easy way to manage your fleet.**

The purpose of Fleet Management in a business is to ensure the work vehicles of a business are operating smoothly, are constantly seeking ways to improve performance, are able to keep operation costs at a minimum, and maintain compliance with company regulations.

**Fleet management system (FMS)** : is the applications, tools, technologies and practices that help businesses maintain optimal use of their work vehicles from a central platform.

## **Required Scope**

We have the below assumption and considerations of the required business:

- We have a number of connected vehicles that belongs to a number of customers.
- We have a need to be able to view the status of the connection among these vehicles on a monitoring display.
- The vehicles send the status of the connection one time per minute.
- The status can be compared with a ping (network trace); no request from the vehicle means no connection. 
- So, vehicle is either Connected or Disconnected.


## **Task**
- The task is to create a data store that keeps these vehicles with their status and the customers who own them, as well as a GUI (preferably web-based) that displays the status.
- Obviously, for this task, there are no real vehicles available that can respond to your "ping" request.
- This can either be solved by using static values or by creating a separate machinery that returns random fake status.

## **Requirements**
1. Web GUI (Single Page Application Framework/Platform).
	 - An overview of all vehicles should be visible on one page (full-screen display), together with their status.
	 - It should be able to filter, to only show vehicles for a specific customer.
	 - It should be able to filter, to only show vehicles that have a specific status.
2. Random simulation to vehicles status sending.

# **Architecture**
We will build the required FMS using Microservices Architecture using Spring Boot, Spring Cloud and Docker. With a pretty neat user interface, by the way.

## **Functional services**

FMS will be decomposed into three core microservices. All of them are independently deployable applications, organized around certain business domains.

**Vehicle service**

Contains general vehicle methods which commonly used by other clients: retrieve vehicle details and register/update vehicle data.

**Customer service**

Contains general customer methods which commonly used by other clients: retrieve customer details and register/update customer data.


**Status service**

Preform calculations on specific data values and capture updated time stamp for each vehicle. This data is used to track the vehicle status.


Notes:

-	Most microservices have their own database, so there is no way to bypass API and access persistence data directly.
-	Some business transactions need to query data that is owned by multiple services. For example, the Status service must query the Vehcle to calculate the status and Customer to associate it to the vehicle.
-	Using a database per service has the following benefits:
    -	Helps ensure that the services are loosely coupled. Changes to one serviceâ€™s database does not impact any other services.
    - Each service can use the type of database that is best suited to its needs. For example, a service that does text searches could use ElasticSearch. A service that manipulates a social graph could use Neo4j.
- In this project, I use MongoDB as a primary database for each service.
- Service-to-service communication is quite simplified: microservices talking using only synchronous REST API. Common practice in a real-world systems is to use combination of interaction styles. For example, perform synchronous GET request to retrieve data and use asynchronous approach via Message broker for create/update operations in order to decouple services and buffer messages. However, this brings us to the eventual consistency world.
